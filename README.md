# PQC Messenger

> A proof-of-concept secure messenger app using **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)** — implemented for academic research.
> 
**"Post-Quantum Cryptography: Implementation of McEliece in the Example of a Messenger App"**

---

## 📌 Project Structure

- `app/src/main/java/org/niklasunrau/pqcmessenger/`  
  → Main application source code

- `domain/crypto/`  
  → Core cryptographic components and PQC logic (including McEliece implementation)

- `gradle/`  
  → Gradle wrapper and build system

---

## 🔐 Features

- Uses **McEliece cryptosystem**, a PQC algorithm designed to be secure against quantum computers.
- Encrypted messaging between users.
- Lightweight Android-based architecture.
- Separation of concerns via `domain/crypto`.

## 🧪 Status

This project is a **research-grade prototype** and not intended for production use.  
Security has not been audited, and the app was built primarily for academic purposes.

---
